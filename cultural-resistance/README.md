## Start with small changes

- Overcome fear and develop trust through controlled exposures
- Start small, don't change everything at once

**Questions:**

How does this style fit with your current culture?
What resistance is this likely to be met with?
Do constraints exist that limit openness?

### Suggestion example

Set up a GitHub Pages site on your GitHub Enterprise instance, and get developers blogging, publishing posts via pull requests leveraging the GitHub Flow.

Benefits of this approach include:

- Working on a non-production, non-commercial environment.
- Increasing comfort with sharing ideas and feedback with one another through hands-on practice.
- Developing a habit around the important practice of writing things down.
- Applying the GitHub Flow, which we consider to be an ideal workflow to strive for in any development environment.
- Leveraging continuous integration (CI), lowering contributor friction, and allowing reviews to focus on substance.
