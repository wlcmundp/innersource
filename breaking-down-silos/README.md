## What's wrong with silos?

- **Communication between the silos can become difficult**, and problems can cascade through the company.
- Silos make the world of permissions a devastating mass of unproductively as **people swim upstream to find the tribal knowledge locked away in the silos**.

## Transparency Boosts Decision Making

Transparency improves collaboration, and empowers anyone within the company to see when a project is going off track and help to fix it.

People need three things to participate in decision-making:

1. **Information** which documentation provides
1. **Access** which comes in meetings, communication channels
1. **Permission** which must become part of the InnerSource culture

## How to Succeed in Complex Environments

**Start with strategy**

Below are four steps to encourage a unified vision within your organization:

1. Work towards a common goal
1. Motivate and incentivize
1. Collaborate and create
1. Execute and measure

### Four step activity questions:

1. What are some common goals that the organization can work towards?
  - What are some early success criteria that would promote sharing the progress towards those goals?
1. What behaviors do you currently incentivize and motivate employees to do?
  - How could existing methods be utilized for this initiative?
1. What internal projects come to mind when you think of collaboration (Does not need to be developer focused)?
  - What do you think causes that(those) project(s) to be successful?
  - What can you use in those projects for this initiative?
1. What would you want to measure to identify the success of the initiative?
